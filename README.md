<b>License: </b> <h3>APACHE V2</h3>
Basically for those who don't know APACHE V2, you can use it as you wish, edit, publish as your own, but you have to post the LICENSE, the copyright and that's it :)
<br>
<b>Notes</b><br>
Ok you need to change a few things, first your DB Settings and other settings can be found under config/config.php.<br>
If you are gonna use Facebook, twiiter and/or Google login, you need to setup your keys (public and secret API keys) in the file app/init.php<br>
You have to change all the URL's with localhost to your actual website.<br>
I think that's all you need to change. Of course you can give it another name by heading to config.php and change the SITE_NAME variable.<br>
<br>
All I ask if you use this is a little credit for me and the people that helped make this real, if you don't mind.<br>
