<b>Notes</b><br>
Ok you need to change a few things, first your DB Settings and other settings can be found under config/config.php.<br>
If you are gonna use Facebook, twiiter and/or Google login, you need to setup your keys (public and secret API keys) in the file app/init.php<br>
You have to change all the URL's with localhost to your actual website.<br>
I think that's all you need to change. Of course you can give it another name by heading to config.php and change the SITE_NAME variable.<br>
<br>
All I ask if you use this is a little credit for me and the people that helped make this real, if you don't mind.<br>
